// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
see if the remainder is zero after dividing by 2 with modulo
print even if is zero
print odd if is not zero

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
have two variables set to 100 for smallest and 0 for largest
loop through all 5 numbers
if a number is smaller than smallest, it's the new smallest
if it's larger than largest, it's the new largest
print "smallest = 'smallest variable', largest = 'largest variable"
